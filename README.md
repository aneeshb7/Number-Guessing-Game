## Number Guessing Game

- *What will the application do?*

The application will be a simple number guessing game. A random number will be generated by the computer
and the player will input guesses. If the input is not equal to the generated number, the application will
return "higher" or "lower" accordingly. If the input is equal to the generated number, the application will return 
some sort of congratulatory message. The user will specify the range of numbers from which the computer can generate 
the random number, as well as the number of attempts they would like to have to guess the number. There is also saving 
and loading functionality with the use of JSON objects. 

- *Who will use it?*

Anyone who wants to play a simple game to kill time can use this application. People who want to test their luck or 
deductive reasoning skills may also play it and increase the difficulty settings to give themselves a satisfying and 
rewarding experience.
